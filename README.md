# 🚀 TOEICKilla - Vocabulary Manager 📖

TOEICKilla is a **vocabulary management application** built with **Python** and **PyQt5**. It uses a **Binary Search Tree (BST) 🌳** to efficiently store and retrieve word translations, allowing users to:

✅ **Search** for a translation 🔎\
✅ **Add** new words ➕\
✅ **Modify** existing translations ✏️\
✅ **Delete** words from the vocabulary ❌

## 🌳 Binary Search Tree (BST) 🔍

TOEICKilla uses a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** to store and retrieve words efficiently. In a BST:

- Each node contains a **word** and its **translation**.
- Words are stored in **sorted order**, allowing **fast searching** (O(log n) time complexity).
- Searching follows a **left (smaller) / right (greater) rule**, ensuring efficient traversal.

This makes the dictionary **scalable** and **optimized** for large datasets! ⚡
